                Welcome to Looky ("Looky," "we," "us" or "our"). Looky provides a fast, helpful and creative way for you
                to share with others when a pet is found or lost, in order to help that pet to return home.

            <ul>
                <li>Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share and protect
                    information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or in connection
                    with Looky services (collectively, the "Service"), and your choices about the collection and use of your information.</li>
                <li>By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post content,
                    including photos, comments and other materials ("User Content"), to the Service and to share User Content publicly.
                    This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of your User Content that you make publicly
                    available through the Service, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our
                    Terms of Use (which can be found at http://www.looky-pets.com/legal/terms).</li>
                <li>Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("Users").</li>

            <h3>
                1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT
            </h3>

            <p>
                We collect the following types of information.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Information you provide us directly:</strong>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Your name, password, phone number and e-mail address when you register for an Looky account.</li>
                <li>Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone number).
                    This information allows us to help you or others be "found" on Looky.</li>
                <li>User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.</li>
                <li>Communications between you and Looky. For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., account
                    verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that you may
                    not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <strong>Analytics information:</strong>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools
                    collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons,
                    and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information
                    with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local
                    storage to collect information about how you use Looky and provide features to you.</li>
                <li>We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use cookies or
                    similar technologies placed by us or the third party.</li>
                <li>More information is available in our About Cookies section</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <strong>Log file information:</strong>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access
                    (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device.</li>
                <li>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your
                    web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of
                    clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other
                    such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then help us
                    track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <strong>Device identifiers:</strong>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor,
                    store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small
                    data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify
                    your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored
                    in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Looky.</li>
                <li>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use
                    the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the
                    Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <strong>Metadata:</strong>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe
                    how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted.</li>
                <li>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords
                    when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark pet location location to a photo), comments or other data. This makes
                    your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>
                2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
            </h3>

            <p>
                In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use information that we receive to:

            <h3>
                3. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION
            </h3>

            <p>
                We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Looky (or the group of companies of which
                Looky is a part) without your consent, except as noted in this Policy.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Parties with whom we may share your information:</strong>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to, information from cookies,
                    log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally part of the
                    same group of companies that Looky is part of, or that become part of that group ("Affiliates"). Affiliates
                    may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service (including by providing analytics)
                    and Affiliates' own services (including by providing you with better and more relevant experiences). But these
                    Affiliates will honor the choices you make about who can see your photos.</li>
                <li>We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and device
                    identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to you
                    ("Service Providers"). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is reasonably
                    necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.</li>
                <li>We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners. This
                    information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements
                    that they believe will be of most interest to you.</li>
                <li>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties. We may
                    also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer associated with you
                    and share that aggregated information.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <strong>Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:</strong>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content,
                    becomes available to the public. Once you have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others.</li>
                <li>Subject to your profile and privacy settings, any User Content that you make public is searchable by other
                    Users and subject to use under our Looky API. The use of the Looky API is subject to the API Terms of Use
                    which incorporates the terms of this Privacy Policy.</li>
                <li>If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived
                    pages of the Service, or if other Users or third parties using the Service have copied or saved that information.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <strong>What happens in the event of a change of control:</strong>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Looky or our assets to another organization
                    (e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation),
                    your information such as name and email address, User Content and any other information collected through
                    the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User Content.
                    The buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <strong>Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:</strong>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search warrant,
                    court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include
                    responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of Colombia where we have a good faith belief
                    that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent
                    with internationally recognized standards. We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a
                    good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect
                    ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.
                    Information we receive about you may be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it
                    is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible
                    violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.</li>
